Q1]Design and implement a multi-threaded application that finds the occurrence(s) of a string in a text file of 100GB. 
It should return the line-number(s) in which the match(es) is/are found. 

Need not worry about the system constraints in spawning and running threads. 
There is a 32 core CPU with immense power. Huge amount of RAM. 

The result should be returned in few sec.

(Possible) Ans:- 
Read entire file in Memory.
It involves 2 actions. Start 32 threads working in parallel on chunks of every roughly 300Mb. 
Because searching is CPU intensive there is no point creating more than 32 threads since there are 32 cores and all of them will be busy.

How to optimize searching further:
Create a trie of every chunk where each node stores the word along with the line number that it appears in.

Q2]different between exec and fork. will parent process and child process 
in deadlock if parent is using resource and child will also get same resource ? 
what if parent contains two threads ? will child also get 2 threads ? how fork will be thread safe ?
